A deep dive into neural networks.

Defining network in Numpy.NET. For more information, go to [this repository](https://github.com/zllz4/numpy-network)

## Purpose

- For education rather than for production.
- OOP-friendly and maintainable machine learning code.
- Reduce stupid errors before compile time.
- Prefer robust coding than less typing.

## Restriction

Currently Windows only.

## Notices

- `lossXXXXXGradient.shape == XXXXX.shape`
